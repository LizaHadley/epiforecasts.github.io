abstract = "Estimation of the effective reproductive number Rt is important
            for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During
            the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers
            and public health officials are using Rt to assess the
            effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However,
            estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges,
            with critical implications for the interpretation of the course
            of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize
            these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic
            data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near
            real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and
            colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical
            estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods
            that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis,
            are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near
            real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective
            analyses of how individuals infected at different time points
            contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods
            derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the
            resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural
            assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all
            approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval
            and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from
            observations occurring long after the moment of transmission.
            Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as
            subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce
            bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other
            technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt
            estimation.",

abstract  = "Background: Assessing temporal variations in transmission in
             different countries is essential for monitoring the epidemic,
             evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions and
             estimating the impact of changes in policy. Methods: We use case
             and death notification data to generate daily estimates of the
             time-varying reproduction number globally, regionally,
             nationally, and subnationally over a 12-week rolling window. Our
             modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for
             uncertainty in reporting delays, so that the reproduction number
             is estimated based on underlying latent infections. Results:
             Estimates of the reproduction number, trajectories of
             infections, and forecasts are displayed on a dedicated website
             as both maps and time series, and made available to download in
             tabular form. Conclusions: This decision-support tool can be
             used to assess changes in virus transmission both globally,
             regionally, nationally, and subnationally. This allows public
             health officials and policymakers to track the progress of the
             outbreak in near real-time using an epidemiologically valid
             measure. As well as providing regular updates on our website, we
             also provide an open source tool-set so that our approach can be
             used directly by researchers and policymakers on confidential
             data-sets. We hope that our tool will be used to support
             decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19
             pandemic.",
