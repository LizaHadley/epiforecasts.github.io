               Rohingya from Myanmar fled into Bangladesh, settling in informal
               makeshift camps in Cox's Bazar district and joining 212,000
               Rohingya already present. In early November, a diphtheria
               outbreak hit the camps, with 440 reported cases during the first
               month. A rise in cases during early December led to a
               collaboration between teams from M{\'e}decins sans
               Fronti{\`e}res-who were running a provisional diphtheria
               treatment centre-and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
               Medicine with the goal to use transmission dynamic models to
               forecast the potential scale of the outbreak and the resulting
               resource needs. METHODS: We first adjusted for delays between
               symptom onset and case presentation using the observed
               distribution of reporting delays from previously reported cases.
               We then fit a compartmental transmission model to the adjusted
               incidence stratified by age group and location. Model forecasts
               with a lead time of 2 weeks were issued on 12, 20, 26 and 30
               December and communicated to decision-makers. RESULTS: The first
               forecast estimated that the outbreak would peak on 19 December
               in Balukhali camp with 303 (95\% posterior predictive interval
               122-599) cases and would continue to grow in Kutupalong camp,
               requiring a bed capacity of 316 (95\% posterior predictive
               interval (PPI) 197-499). On 19 December, a total of 54 cases
               were reported, lower than forecasted. Subsequent forecasts were
               more accurate: on 20 December, we predicted a total of 912 cases
               (95\% PPI 367-2183) and 136 (95\% PPI 55-327) hospitalizations
               until the end of the year, with 616 cases actually reported
               during this period. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time modelling enabled
               feedback of key information about the potential scale of the
               epidemic, resource needs and mechanisms of transmission to
               decision-makers at a time when this information was largely
               unknown. By 20 December, the model generated reliable forecasts
               and helped support decision-making on operational aspects of the
               outbreak response, such as hospital bed and staff needs, and
               with advocacy for control measures. Although modelling is only
               one component of the evidence base for decision-making in
               outbreak situations, suitable analysis and forecasting
               techniques can be used to gain insights into an ongoing
               outbreak.",
