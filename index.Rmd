We are a research group based at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) working on real-time modelling of infectious disease outbreaks. On this site you can find links to regularly updated forecasts of some ongoing outbreaks as well as some posts about forecasts we have made during previous outbreaks. To find out more about the team visit our [about us](./aboutus) page.
